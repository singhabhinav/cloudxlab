Write a function to compute income tax. We have shown two approaches. Feel free
to write your own logic to compute tax. Income is displayed in Indian currency.
As shown below in the slabs table, if your annual income is less than INR
300,000 you will not have to pay any taxes. You will have to pay 10% taxes for
the income in the range of INR 300,001 - 400,000, 20% taxes for the income in
the range of INR 400,001 - 500,000 and so on

**Income(Range)       Tax**

0 - 300,000           0

300,001 - 400,000     10%

400,001 - 500,000     20%

500,001 - onwards     30%

**Testcases-**

If your income is 400000, your function should return 10000

If your income is 450000, your function should return 20000

If your income is 550000, your function should return 45000
